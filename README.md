# parse_ics_to_md
small php script to turn events in an ICS file into markdown notes by date

run the script e.g. using a local web server on your computer, from the folder where the ics source file is. The output follows my personal preferred folder structure and shapes the outputfiles per day the way I structure my own day logs. Adapt as needed.
